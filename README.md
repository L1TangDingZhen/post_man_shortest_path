# Postal Round Route Optimizer

Computes the shortest route that covers every street of a delivery round —
a real-world instance of the **Rural Postman Problem** (the
territory-restricted generalisation of the classic Chinese Postman
Problem), solved exactly, on real OpenStreetMap data.

Born on a real postal round ridden on an electric delivery vehicle; works
for any area on Earth that OSM covers — delivery rounds, leaflet drops,
street sweeps, "run every street" challenges.

## How it works

```
OpenStreetMap ──► extract_network.py ──► edges.csv  (you edit `service`)
                                         nodes.csv
                                         preview.html
edges.csv (edited) ──► solve_route.py ──► route.csv      (ordered street list
                                          route_map.html  = new sort sequence)
```

The single source of truth is the `service` column of `edges.csv`:

| value | meaning | traversals |
|------:|---------|-----------|
| `2` | I deliver **both sides** of this street (default) | 2 — one per side |
| `1` | I deliver **one side only**, *or* I zigzag both sides in a single pass | 1 |
| `0` | **Not my street**, but I may ride along it as a shortcut | 0 required (free deadhead) |
| `x` | **Never use** — steps, unrideable paths, hostile crossings | edge removed from the graph (not even deadhead) |

This one mechanism covers every customisation a real round needs:
adding/removing streets from your territory, one-side-only boundary
roads (e.g. divided arterials where you serve a single carriageway), and
per-street zigzag decisions. Boundaries that cut a street mid-block are
handled by the edge-split utility (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, SPEC-1).

## Quick start (demo area)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Extract a demo network (needs internet; ~10 s)
python extract_network.py --place "Albert Park, Victoria, Australia" --out data

# 2. Open data/preview.html in a browser and data/edges.csv in a
#    spreadsheet. Edit the service column (sorted by street name, so a
#    whole street can be set in one block).

# 3. Solve
python solve_route.py --data data --out result
```

Then open `result/route_map.html` — an interactive viewer: drag the
slider (or press ←/→, or hit play) to walk the route step by step;
the current segment is highlighted with a direction arrow, service
passes are solid, deadhead dashed. `result/route.csv` is the same
route as an ordered street list — each row gives street, pass number,
compass direction, the cross streets at each end, and cumulative
distance.

## Editing the service column graphically

Editing hundreds of rows by edge_id is tedious — run the click-editor
instead:

```bash
python make_editor.py --data data --serve
```

Open the printed URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`): every edge
is drawn over a
basemap, coloured by service (blue 2 / orange 1 / grey dashed 0).
Click to cycle 2 → 1 → 0 (ctrl-click sets 0 directly — the common
"not my street" case; shift-click toggles `x` = banned, e.g. for
steps). For long stretches of the same value, switch **click sets**
from `cycle` to a fixed value and just paint. Picking always targets
the edge nearest to
the cursor — the hovered edge is thickened and captioned first, so
you can see what a click will change, and zoom reaches building
level: even metre-long slivers of split streets are selectable.
Type a street name or a road type (`trunk`, `steps`, …) to bulk-set
all matched segments at once. Live counters show edges per value, mandatory km
and unsaved changes; undo works across bulk operations.

**Right-click** anywhere on the map to set that point as the round's
**START** or **END** (or just copy the coordinates). The endpoints are
stored in `data/endpoints.json`, drawn as markers, and reused on every
reload; tick *return to start* for a closed tour. Then press
**Solve route** — the solver runs and the finished route map opens in
a new tab. The whole loop stays in the browser; `solve_route.py` picks
the same endpoints up automatically when run without `--start`/`--end`.

**show islands** colours each connected component of your service
streets separately (with per-island zoom buttons) — one island means
the solver's optimum is exact; stray extra islands are usually
annotation gaps, easiest to spot and fix right there.

**Save** writes straight back to `data/edges.csv` (all columns
preserved, only `service` changed; the previous version is kept as
`edges.csv.bak`) — then just re-run `solve_route.py`. Every page
reload shows the file as it currently is on disk, so the editor is
never stale. The server binds localhost only; your round never
leaves your machine.

Without `--serve`, `make_editor.py` writes a static
`data/editor.html` snapshot whose **Export** button downloads an
edges.csv to copy over `data/edges.csv` manually — workable, but you
must re-run `make_editor.py` after replacing the file, or the page
keeps showing the old embedded data.

## Running it on your own round (privacy)

Your edited `edges.csv` **is** your round definition — treat it as
private data. This repository is set up so that nothing personal ever
needs to be committed:

- `data/`, `result/`, `*.geojson` and `*.gpx` are gitignored. Your real
  place names, polygons, service edits and any GPS traces stay on your
  machine only.
- All tracked examples, tests and docs use the demo area or synthetic
  coordinates. Keep it that way in contributions.
- Before your first push, grep the repo for your own round's place
  names as a final check.

## Options

```bash
# Open route: start and end may differ; the solver picks the endpoint
# pair that minimises total distance (never longer than the circuit)
python solve_route.py --data data --out result --open

# Pin the start (snapped to the nearest service-street node).
# Note the equals sign -- southern latitudes are negative:
python solve_route.py --data data --out result --start=-37.8406,144.9541

# Fixed start AND end (e.g. depot -> round -> parcel-handover office):
# jointly optimised open route via a zero-length virtual required edge.
# Both points snap to the full network, so they may sit on service-0
# corridor streets. --end alone pins just the finish.
python solve_route.py --data data --out result \
    --start=-37.8406,144.9541 --end=-37.8380,144.9520

# Closed tour: same, plus the shortest ride from the end back to the
# start (depot -> round -> handover office -> depot). The office visit
# is last-before-home, so the return leg is a constant and joint
# optimality is preserved.
python solve_route.py --data data --out result \
    --start=-37.8406,144.9541 --end=-37.8380,144.9520 --return-to-start

# Tip: right-click in the editor (make_editor.py --serve) to copy any
# point as a ready-made --start=/--end= argument; the extraction
# preview shows coordinates on click too.

# Use an exact hand-drawn boundary instead of place names:
# draw a polygon at https://geojson.io, save it, then
python extract_network.py --polygon round.geojson --out data

# A delivery boundary that cuts a street mid-block (house-number
# cutoff): split the edge at that point, then set the outer child's
# service to 0. Snaps to the intersection if you click near one.
python split_edge.py --data data --at=-37.8450,144.9505

# Network type (default `walk`, closest to a delivery vehicle on
# footpaths; includes paths and laneways that make good shortcuts):
python extract_network.py --place ... --network-type bike --out data
```

## Re-extracting without losing your annotation

Re-running the extraction regenerates `edges.csv` and would wipe every
`service` edit and split. When you need a bigger area (say, to bring a
depot or a handover office into the network), snapshot first:

```bash
# 1. freeze the current annotation into the gitignored round dir
python prepare_round.py --data data --round round.local --export

# 2. enlarge your polygon (geojson.io), then re-extract; default 0
#    makes the newly added streets arrive as connectors, not service
python extract_network.py --polygon round.local/my_round.geojson \
    --default-service 0 --out data

# 3. replay splits + service values onto the fresh extraction
python prepare_round.py --data data --round round.local
```

Edges that are new to the enlarged area keep the extraction default
and are reported — review them in the editor. Stale overrides (ids
that no longer exist) are warned about, never silently dropped.

## Version history — did that edit actually help?

Add `--history` to any solve and the run is filed away: the round
definition at that moment, the route it produced, and the totals.

```bash
python solve_route.py --data data --out result --history \
    --note "after fixing the sliver gaps"

python round_history.py list          # every version, newest last
python round_history.py diff          # what changed between the last two
python round_history.py diff 2026 -1  # by id prefix or negative index
python round_history.py show -1       # one version in full
```

`list` shows service / total / deadhead km and the island count per
version, with the change in total distance since the previous one.
`diff` names the streets added to or dropped from the round and the
resulting distance deltas — so "I marked 19 slivers, did the route get
shorter?" has an answer instead of a feeling.

Versions live in `round.local/history/<id>/` (gitignored), each with
`service.csv`, `summary.json`, `route.csv` and a copy of
`route_map.html` you can still open months later. Re-solving an
unchanged round does not create a duplicate. The editor's **Solve
route** button records versions automatically and lists the recent
ones under the button.

## Reading the result

The console summary separates what optimisation can and cannot change:

```
Mandatory service riding :   18.42 km   (theoretical lower bound)
Route total              :   19.87 km
Extra / deadhead         :    1.45 km   (7.3% of route)
```

The mandatory part is the job itself — every service street times its
multiplicity. The **extra** is the only optimisable quantity, and the
algorithm guarantees it is minimal **when the service streets form one
connected piece**. If they do not, the solver bridges the islands with
a minimum spanning tree, warns, and reports how many kilometres that
bridging accounts for — that figure is the only part of the answer
that is not provably minimal. Use the editor's *show islands* view to
merge stray islands and get back to an exact result; see
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (E3) for why optimal island connection is a
harder problem.

`route.csv` doubles as the basis for a new **sort sequence**: mail is
bundled in row order; a `2/2` pass is the same street's other side.

## Testing

```bash
python test_solve.py
python test_editor.py
python test_split.py
python test_prepare.py
python test_history.py
```

Runs the solver on a synthetic street grid (no internet needed) and
asserts: exact service multiplicities, walk continuity, circuit closure,
open ≤ circuit, correct auto-bridging of disconnected service sets, and
exclusion of `service=x` edges. `test_editor.py` covers the editor:
payload round-trip, hostile street names, WKT parsing, blank/bad
service handling, and the `--serve` save-back loop. `test_split.py`
covers the edge splitter: mid-edge splits, intersection snapping,
mis-click guard, composition, and solver invariants on split data.

## Development
